AJ General Libraries
====================

Theese are some PHP libraries that I use for every day work. As I work primarly with the [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com), theese libraries are heavily inspired by this framework. Theese libraries complement ZF to satisfy my needs.

If you find them usefull, you can reuse them under the [AGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

If you need to use them under a less restrictive license, please, fell free to contact me.
